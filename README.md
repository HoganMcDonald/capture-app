# capture-app

Capture is a full-stack, mobile-first content creation assistant that will allows users to store pieces of information (inspiring quotes, stories, pictures, etc.), and organize them based on their content creation strategy. Users will first interact with a simple page that allows them to quickly input text or upload images to their Capture Feed. Users can then sort the snippets on their Capture Feed into custom Buckets where they are able to construct the basic outline of a speech, blog post, short story, etc. The app will leverage the IBM Watson API to store detailed information about the tone of the snippets that users upload.

The concept is that this spreads the task of content creation out. Content creators can easily capture their most inspiring ideas at the exact moment they think of them so that less time is spent remembering things, and more time can be spent writing and preparing.
